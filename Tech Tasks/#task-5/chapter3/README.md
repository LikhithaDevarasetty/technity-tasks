CHAPTER 3:- <br/>
<br/>
Functions are advantageous in programs because they allow for code reusability, modularity, and organization. They help in avoiding redundancy and making complex programs more manageable. <br/>
The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when it's defined. <br/>
The def statement creates a function in Python. <br/>
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task, while a function call is the act of using that function to execute its code. <br/>
There is one global scope in a Python program. Local scopes are created when functions are called, so there can be multiple local scopes, each associated with a function call. <br/> 
Variables in a local scope are destroyed when the function call returns, and the local scope is destroyed. <br/>
A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Yes, a return value can be part of an expression. <br/>
If a function does not have a return statement, its return value is None. <br/>
You can use the global keyword inside the function to indicate that a variable should refer to the global variable instead of creating a new local variable. <br/>
The data type of None is NoneType. <br/>
The statement import areallyourpetsnamederic doesn't have a predefined effect in Python. It would raise an ImportError unless you have a module named areallyourpetsnamederic. <br/>
If you had a function named bacon() in a module named spam, you would call it after importing spam using spam.bacon(). <br/>
You can prevent a program from crashing by handling errors using try-except blocks. This way, if an error occurs, the program can gracefully handle the error and continue executing. <br/>
In a try clause, you place the code that you suspect might raise an exception. In an except clause, you handle the exception by providing the code to execute if the associated error occurs.
