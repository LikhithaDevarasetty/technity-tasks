CHAPTER 2 :- <br/>
<br/>
Two Boolean values: True and False. <br/>
Three Boolean operators: and, or, not. <br/>
Six comparison operators: == (equal), != (not equal), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to). <br/>
Equal to operator (==) compares values for equality, while the assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable. <br/>
7)A condition is a Boolean expression used to make decisions in programming. It's used in control structures like if statements and loops to determine the flow of execution based on whether the condition is true or false. <br/>
10)Press Ctrl+C. <br/>
break is used to exit a loop completely, while continue is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. <br/>
range(10) generates numbers from 0 to 9. All three forms are equivalent. <br/>
If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, you would call it after importing spam usingÂ spam.bacon(). <br/>
